Description: uncompromising Python code formatter (Python 3)
 Black is the uncompromising Python code formatter. By using it, you 
 agree to cede control over minutiae of hand-formatting. In return, 
 Black gives you speed, determinism, and freedom from pycodestyle 
 nagging about formatting. You will save time and mental energy for 
 more important matters.
 .
 Blackened code looks the same regardless of the project you're reading. 
 Formatting becomes transparent after a while and you can focus on the 
 content instead.
 .
 Black makes code review faster by producing the smallest diffs 
 possible.
