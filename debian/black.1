.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBblack\fP is the uncompromising Python code formatter.
.SS Summary
.sp
\fBblack\fP is the uncompromising Python code formatter. By using it,
you  agree to cede control over minutiae of hand\-formatting. In return,
Black gives you speed, determinism, and freedom from pycodestyle
nagging about formatting. You will save time and mental energy for
more important matters.

\-l, \-\-line\-length INTEGER       How many characters per line to allow.
                                [default: 88]

\-\-py36                          Allow using Python 3.6\-only syntax on all
                                input files.  This will put trailing commas
                                in function signatures and calls also after
                                *args and **kwargs.  [default: per\-file
                                auto\-detection]

\-\-pyi                           Format all input files like typing stubs
                                regardless of file extension (useful when
                                piping source on standard input).

\-S, \-\-skip\-string\-normalization
                                Don\(aqt normalize string quotes or prefixes.

\-\-check                         Don\(aqt write the files back, just return the
                                status.  Return code 0 means nothing would
                                change.  Return code 1 means some files
                                would be reformatted.  Return code 123 means
                                there was an internal error.

\-\-diff                          Don\(aqt write the files back, just output a
                                diff for each file on stdout.

\-\-fast / \-\-safe                 If \-\-fast given, skip temporary sanity
                                checks. [default: \-\-safe]

\-\-include TEXT                  A regular expression that matches files and
                                directories that should be included on
                                recursive searches.  An empty value means
                                all files are included regardless of the
                                name.  Use forward slashes for directories
                                on all platforms (Windows, too).  Exclusions
                                are calculated first, inclusions later.
                                [default: \e.pyi?$]

\-\-exclude TEXT                  A regular expression that matches files and
                                directories that should be excluded on
                                recursive searches.  An empty value means no
                                paths are excluded. Use forward slashes for
                                directories on all platforms (Windows, too).
                                Exclusions are calculated first, inclusions
                                later.  [default: /(\e.git|\e.hg|\e.mypy_cache|
                                \e.tox|\e.venv|_build|buck\-out|build|dist)/]

\-q, \-\-quiet                     Don\(aqt emit non\-error messages to stderr.
                                Errors are still emitted, silence those with
                                2>/dev/null.

\-v, \-\-verbose                   Also emit messages to stderr about files
                                that were not changed or were ignored due to
                                \-\-exclude=.

\-\-version                       Show the version and exit.

\-\-config FILE                   Read configuration from PATH.

\-h, \-\-help                      Show this message and exit.
